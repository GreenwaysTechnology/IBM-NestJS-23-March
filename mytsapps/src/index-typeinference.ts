//type declaration patterns.
//explicit type declaration
//implicit type declaration : type inference

//explicit type ; the type of firstName is string
let firstName: string = "Subramanian"
console.log(firstName)
firstName = "Murugan"
console.log(firstName)

//implicit type ; the type of variable not said during declaration

//here the type of lastName is understood that string : type inference
let lastName ="Murugan"
lastName="Subramanian"
//lastName=true error
